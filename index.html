            We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. Let the
            paint work. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Mix your color
            marbly don't mix it dead. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.
            <p>You can do anything your heart can imagine. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Just
                let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done
                anything to it yet.</p>

                Mountains are so simple, they're hard. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. This is a fantastic little
                painting.</p>
